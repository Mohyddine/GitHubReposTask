GitHubReposTask
Idea of the App The task is to implement a small App that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. Fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API.

Features

● As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

● As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.

● As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :

○ Repository name

○ Repository description

○ Number of stars for the repo.

○ Number of issues for the repo.

○ Username and avatar of the owner.

● As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).
